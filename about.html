                <p class= "text" style= "color:white; font-size:20px; font-weight: 100">Ending the technical events then started the cultural performances hosted on the stage that had been dealt keenly and with lot of efforts set for vulcanzy 2k18.
                        It was a mixture of music, dance and dramas which were performed and showcased perfectly on the stage with having a LED screen as an added advantage. 
                        Few highlight performances were 
                        • The Mime which showed how Technology is influencing human life and how people are getting addicted to technology and social media.
                        • Chaavat boys: It is a mixture of dance, drama and music focused on entertaining the audience in their own funny ways by various acts and dance steps. It was one of the most loved performance of the night.
                        • Apart from all the amazing stage performances there was an exceptional performance by our students from the Dance Club who respected a farmer’s life .We are so busy with our current life that we tend to forget the little details in our daily life. Everyday tonnes of food is being wasted across the globe. Are we really showing the gratitude towards the food we have everyday? Do we really value the efforts put by a farmer to cultivate? Therefore our students portrayed the difficulties faced by a peasant after a continuous effort everyday, depending upon the climate which always leaves him helpless, and facing heartless money lenders is definitely not a cake walk.
                        • The main attraction that dragged all the students attention was the Ritzy. There was no theme for this round. All the participants dressed up to look up the best and were judged by few faculty based on their walk, attire and few other parameters. 
                        The second day got wrapped with a huge number of interesting and entertaining performances.
                        
                        The third day started with promotions of the movie Aithe2.0 which cheered up all the students and it ended up with selfies all over the main block with the cast and crew. With the cultural club taking over the day, a vast number of events like Doodle it, Beat Quest, Whirlophile, Sherlock, Passcode were conducted which showcased the talents of the students. Ending up the events and competitions by the evening, it was the cultural performances that refilled the energy in the students. Few highlights on day3 were
                        • Collaboration between music and drama:
                        This one was the 1st attempt made by two clubs. It was successfully carried out by singers and drama club members performing various songs and act accordingly which audience like a lot. 
                        • Ritzy was back again with a bang on the day3 which was on western theme. 
                        The legacy of NIT-Andhra Pradesh on closing ceremony of the vulcanzy was a show stopper where students let their lanterns into the dark sky which were dancing a waltz on all souls that night.
                        And then the much awaited DJ night was set to lit the fest. Till the music was gone the students partied on! The students worked hard, played hard and partied even harder. With the DJ night the vulcanzy get’s wrapped up refilling the energy in students amidst the academics and increased the expectations on vulcanzy 2k19.</p>
